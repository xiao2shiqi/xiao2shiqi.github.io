### Introduction

Moving from a senior engineer to a Tech Lead is a major shift. Currently, I lead a team of about a dozen people, following Amazon's "Two Pizza Rule." I remember initially resisting this role, fearing that management would rob me of my coding time. This post is for those who are just stepping into their first leadership position.

**Key Questions to Explore:**
- What are the core competencies of a Tech Lead?
- How does the mindset change from engineer to leader?
- How can we boost team efficiency and morale?
- How do we handle communication and self-growth?

### 1. Leadership and Competencies

Developers are an "intelligent and proud" group. To earn their respect, a Tech Lead needs:
- **Deep Technical Accuracy**: You must see through the surface and understand the underlying principles of the stack.
- **Communication & Logic**: Being able to explain "why" without being emotional.
- **Business Abstraction**: Translating messy business requirements into clean architecture.

**Leadership is not a title; it is earned by:**
- Understanding the implementation details (never stop coding!).
- Being the "terminator" for the team's toughest technical blockers.
- Having a genuine "servant" mindset to help others grow.

### 2. The Great Role Transition

**Engineer**: Focuses on the "How." Success is defined by completing specific tasks.
**Tech Lead**: Focuses on the "What" and "Why." Success is defined by the team's output, cost, efficiency, and quality.

As a leader, you are like a parent: ensuring the "kids" (team) are growing, and the "grandparents" (upper management) are satisfied.

### 3. Boosting Team Efficiency

Efficiency is a product of **Tools** and **Atmosphere**.
- **Tools**: High-end hardware and smooth CI/CD pipelines. Don't let bureaucracy (e.g., long approval forms) kill the "flow" state.
- **People**: Knowledge workers cannot be micromanaged. High-output employees need both **Capability** and **Intent**. If someone is underperforming, check if the environment is "bitter" for them.

#### Motivation Types
- **Extrinsic**: Achievement feedback, learning environment, and one-on-one communication.
- **Intrinsic (Self-Drive)**: Autonomy (how they work), mastery (challenging tasks), and purpose (shared vision).

### 4. Communication Skills

Trust is the foundation of efficiency. The higher the trust, the lower the communication cost.
- **Listen First**: Use the **3F Listening** method (Facts, Feelings, Focus).
- **Emotion Control**: Our brains handle emotions (anger, fear) faster than logic. Never communicate when you (or they) are hijacked by instinctual emotions.
- **Closing the Loop**: Think of communication like TCP. Don't assume the message was received; wait for the "ACK."

### 5. Self-Cognition and Growth

The leader is the team's ceiling. If you stay stagnant, the team does too.
- **Energy Management**: You can't lead effectively if you're physically or mentally drained. Exercise, sleep, and a good mood are professional requirements.
- **Staying Technical**: If you stop coding, you lose the ability to make grounded decisions. You also become market-fragile if you ever want to return to an engineering role.

### Summary

The most important goal is to find where you provide the most value. Management is about **利他 (Altruism)**—finding fulfillment in the achievements of others.
